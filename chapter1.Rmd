Feeling good. Hoping to learn some R.

## Thoughts on chapter 1 and 4

I'm somewhat familiar with R and using ggplot so this was not too difficult. Still had to think a little bit before could get the 4.6.5 excercise done. I also did like the final graphs in chapter 4, maybe could have some ideas from here to my own work also. R markdown is great way to approach this I think.

Here is my github project: <https://github.com/ukkelinkamu/IODS-project>
