# About the project

This is my course diary for IODS course. Feeling good. Hoping to learn some R.

Here is my github project: <https://github.com/ukkelinkamu/IODS-project>

## Thoughts on chapter 1 and 4

I'm somewhat familiar with R and using ggplot so this was not too difficult. Still had to think a little bit before could get the 4.6.5 excercise done (below). I also did like the final graphs in chapter 4, maybe could have some ideas from here to my own work also. R markdown is great way to approach this I think.

```{r}
gapdata2007 %>% 
  filter(continent %in% c("Europe")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp,
             y = fct_reorder(country, lifeExp, .fun=max))) +
  geom_col(fill = NA, colour = "deepskyblue");

```
