# Chapter 2 - Regression

*We have learned basics of doing regression models and summaraising the data*


```{r}
#I created a csv file in the previous task so I start by reading it
df <- read.csv("a_learn14.csv")
df <- df[,-1]
#exploring the structure and dimensions
str(df)
dim(df)
#There seems to be 166 rows and 7 columns. The data is from student survey. the survey questions had 3 categories and in this dataset they are averaged to 3 columns: attitudes, deep, surf and stra. There is also columns for age and gender.

#access the GGally and ggplot2 libraries
library(GGally)
library(ggplot2)


pairs(df[-1])
summary(df)
p <- ggpairs(df, mapping = aes(), lower = list(combo = wrap("facethist", bins = 20)))
p

#Respondents are young, mean 25.5 years old. 2/3 of respondents are female. The exam points correlate strongly with attitude related questions. 

# fit a linear model
my_model <- lm(Points ~ attitude+stra+surf, df)

# print out a summary of the model
my_model
summary(my_model)

#attitude is strongly and statistically significantly correlated with points. correlation coefficient is 3.4661 and p-value 1.18e^-08. Other correlations are not statistically significant.

#new model without explanatory variables that were not statistically significantly correlated with points
my_model <- lm(Points ~ attitude, df)

#multiple r-squared is 0.1906, which is semi low and means that the data do not fit the model very well, data points are far away from the regression line on average. This can be also used to estimate if the model can predict how good points participant with specific attitudes would get, in this case the model predicts it badly.

#diagnostic plots
plot(my_model, which = c(1,2,5)) 

#diagnostic plost show the model is valid. data points are equally scattered and the red line does not have large curves.
